# [DataDictionary](Pansynchro.Core.DataDict.DataDictionary.html).Name Property

## Definition

Namespace: Pansynchro.Core.DataDict<BR>
Assembly: Pansynchro.Core

The name of the data dictionary.

## Signature
```
public string Name { get; }
```

## Remarks

This gives the dictionary a name.  It has no inherent meaning to the Pansynchro framework, but should be reasonably descriptive for the user's convenience, such as naming it after the database whose schema it represents.
